# TrackChat

We want to be able to track topics from different people in an online chat

## Potential channels

- telegram
- IRC
- whatsapp (*should we do this?*)

## Questions to be answered

- Do we need to use deep learning (DL) for this?
  - deep learning is a trendy topic, but how much does it help?
  - what are the alternatives?

- What would a topic-tracking pipeline look like?
  - parse data
  - group text into conversations
  - building threads

- Graphs including 'speaker'
  - is it more useful to graph utterances?
  - maybe more than one graph?

- Who's been working on this already?
  - very important question. DO NOT WORK ALONE.
