# Challenges to be handled

## Initial Questions

1. telegram allows massive groups, all using multi-modal inputs
2. whatsapp is the same but has no publicised API
3. IRC reply behaviour can be very unpredictable

## Details

### Multimodal inputs

- is the emoji/GIF/link/document relevant?

### Group size

- which reply is to which conversation?
  - reply function is available, but its use is not guaranteed

### Asynchronous Behaviour

- which reply is to which conversation?
  - highlighting is available, but its use is not guaranteed

### Lack of API

- how does one retrieve messages?
  - just don't use WhatsApp for the time being?
